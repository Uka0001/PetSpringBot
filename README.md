# Telegram bot on Spring and Java 11 using 
Ruben Lagus library for creating telegram Bots
----
Task: Create long polling Telegram bot 
(sends a request to Telegram, asking for new updates)
to find lawyers in different regions of Ukraine.
----
Optional: deployment to the Heroku(update it free policy
so it os unavailable to do free deploy from November, 28)
or other free server.
----
Technology used in project: Java 11, Spring Boot 2.7.4,
and Ruben Lagus Java Telegram Bots Library 6.1.0 to create bots
using Telegram Bots API.

Idea: Telegram bot (possibly plugin or website in future) plus
the analogue of upwork for Telegram bot (possibly plugin or website)
in the future) analogue of upwork for delivery/receipt
legal services in Ukraine (so far only Ukraine).
The global idea is to create an independent platform that will be
customers and service providers from different regions.
And the customer will be able to choose the performer in view of his region
service provision, cost, rating, status, quantity
feedback, and other characteristics. Service providers can be
both individual friars (lawyers) and large companies.
The service takes the interest from payment for the work performed
(Just as upwork does). For service providers
there will be an opportunity to get additional clients and services
will be guaranteed paid (an analogue of the site to the upwork, when
the part of the payment is frozen after a particular part of the work).
At the initial stage, it is possible to translate into a telegram bot 
for reception (payment) consultations, quick response, and search of lawyer(lawyer) for urgent requests of clients of type (accident, search, detention). The main branch tries to realize payment in telegram at the beginning for consultation or leaving to the client. In the future, it is possible to make a full web interface and application for mobile money. The backend of the bot can be realized by Java within the internship or as a pet project.
PS: If without a long-term then Telegram bot for searching
lawyer(lawyers) in Ukraine with backend on Java.
